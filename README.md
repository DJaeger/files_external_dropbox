## Steps For Installation
### From App Store
- Install the app from [App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_external_dropbox)
- Enable the app in the web interface
### From Source
- Clone the [source](https://github.com/DJaeger/files_external_dropbox.git) into the Nextcloud apps directory.
- Set the directory ownership according to your setup.
- Run `make` or `composer install` within the apps directory
- Enable the app by running `occ app:enable files_external_dropbox` from nextcloud main directory
### Configuring OAuth2
- Connecting Dropbox is a little more work because you have to create a Dropbox app.
- Log into [Dropbox Developers](http://www.dropbox.com/developers) page and click Create Your App
- Then choose which folders to share, or to share everything in your Dropbox.
- Name Your App and then click Create App
- Under the section **OAuth2** Redirect URIs add a new URL
  - For adding global storages:<br>
    ```https://mynextcloud.example.com/index.php/settings/admin/externalstorages```
  - For user storages:<br>
    ```https://mynextcloud.example.com/index.php/settings/user/externalstorages```

  _Replace `https://mynextcloud.example.com/` with your valid Nextcloud installation path_<br>
  _If you have set `htaccess.RewriteBase` in your config.php you may need to remove index.php and may need to add a subdirectory_
- Then go to nextcloud ```/settings/admin/externalstorages``` and add a new storage **Dropbox V2**
- Fill the details Client Id, Client Secrets from your Dropbox App page (search for "App key" and "App secret")
- Click Grant Access and then you will be redirected to the OAuth login
- After completing the OAuth you will be redirect back to Storage Section and you should see **green** mark along your storage configuration
### Global configuration
